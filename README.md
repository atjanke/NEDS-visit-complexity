# NEDS-visit-complexity: Exploring how treat-and-release ED visits have changed from 2006 to 2019 in the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample

This is code for a broad, ongoing exploratory analysis of treat-and-release ED visits, with an eye towards visit 'complexity' seen through the lens of age, comorbidities, and diagnostic services rendered. This project was supported by the Emergency Medicine Foundation.
